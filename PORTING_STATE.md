## What runs today

Unless marked otherwise, these were observed on the Nova with diagnostic assists
(invincibility, and sometimes high damage or fast charge). They show the systems run;
they are not normal-difficulty acceptance.

- **Catalogs:** all original content catalogs register natively on device (295 items,
  59 equipment, 290 bodies, 204 masters, 563 skills, 76 scenes; zero errors).
- **Menu → run:** recovered offline menu with original difficulty choice, the 20-entry
  survivor roster (profile-eligible ones enabled) and earned loadout choices, then
  original world play.
- **Survivors:** Commando and Huntress by ordinary selection; Bandit2, Toolbot, Engi and
  Loader through developer-only selection (35 s of live Lakes combat each, J504).
- **Stages:** Huntress completed four original boss/charge/exit transitions
  Lakes → Goolake → Wisp Graveyard → Ship Graveyard → Sky Meadow (J504). 23 destinations
  are staged; nine DLC scenes are staged but unplayed pending a truthful expansion-availability
  path. The Gold Shores portal/mission path runs (J485).
- **World:** original director decks and placement, purchases (chests, Turret1, Drone1),
  items, equipment, procs, elites, death → results → restart → menu.
- **Progression:** Android-only native profile, results and settings; original achievement
  classes evaluate at genuine events, and assisted runs are excluded from permanent awards
  (profile holds 13 applied runs).
- **Performance:** 120 Hz display with a 300 FPS request; first stage about 116 FPS under a
  firing workload; crowded later stages fall below 60 FPS with the main thread over budget.

Per-subsystem detail and vocabulary (original / recovered / adapted / approximate /
unavailable): [docs/subsystem-coverage.md](docs/subsystem-coverage.md).

## Open

- An unassisted full run and normal-difficulty combat acceptance.
- Moon, finale and escape: deferred; manual only, never navigated autonomously.
- Stock Steam startup, cloud profiles, platform identity: unavailable by design (no
  fabricated ownership or service success).
- Audio (unavailable), licensed Rewired and generic controllers.
- Complete skill kits, most positive ordinary unlock grants, DLC scene play.
- PC visual parity, sustained 60 FPS and thermals, managed-memory growth across sessions.

## Next actions

1. Fresh-editor code-only builds no longer depend on an earlier bundle build for their
   linker roots (J506); run `./dev check-baseline` after each rebuild
   ([docs/BASELINE.md](docs/BASELINE.md)).
2. Continue broad survivor and special-realm gameplay integration (J504 direction).
   60 FPS is the release target, not a gate for each batch; investigate large
   unexplained regressions only.
3. Keep J503, J502, J425 and J323 executable; sleep the OLED whenever idle.
4. Structural cleanup: Phases 0, 1 and 3–5 of the cleanup plan are done. Phase 2: the runtime
   config and content recipe are generated from public recipes (J551); all 222 adapted assets,
   40 of 229 additions and the three transformed assemblies are reproducible (J552–J563); the 189
   inherited files are in a hash-verified local store (J564). The from-scratch rebuild reproduces
   steps R1–R8 byte-identically (86,433 files) and its binding gate passes (J567–J571); the
   R9 Unity import of the destination, the 352 shader-pipeline outputs, 11 unknown files and
   17 hash-pinned local analysis inputs remain, and the 166 used
   inherited shaders need device-verified regeneration (J558). The remaining
   debt is in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#known-structural-debt).
